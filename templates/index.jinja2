        <p class="ftext">A person can enjoy the actual taste of cake only when it's fresh, this is why all the cakes we deliver are prepared only some time before it reaches to the recipient. To achieve the same, we offer customers to choose delivery time as well, so that we know when we need to prepare a cake and get it delivered. We ensure that customer always enjoys the freshest possible cake. We do not believe in delivering stale cakes.
